        <p>Hello! My name is Rebecca Holt, and when I'm not snuggling my dog, I'm
            spending my time 3D modeling and playing video games with friends! I was born
            in Utah, but was raised in Alberta, Canada. I'm exited to finish my degree
            in software development so I can find a long-term career.

        <p>Alberta is a province in south-west Canada, just east of British Colombia. Alberta is known for it's large
            farming community and large supplies of oil. The rocky mountains makes up half of the western border, so
            there are many beautiful natural parks, including Kananaskis (shown above) and Banff.
